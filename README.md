# DUMB-4-Bit-PCM-Converter
A dumb 4-Bit PCM converter I coded for a dumb project.

Anyone is free to tinker around, I don't really put much serious thoughts into it at the moment.
This project was made for fun, learning, and just experimenting ideas.
In its current form, there is pretty much nothing to be seen, but that's likely going to change in a near future.

How to use: 
- Build and run, that's all there is to show right now.
- This dumb project for now will assume the file 'sample.wav' is 8-bit PCM, RIFF WAV format, they typically have a 44 bytes header before actual data.
- Converted files are saved as 'output.pcm', other than that, there isn't anything really useful from this yet.

How to build:
- Linux: run **cmake** to generate the necessary files, then run **make** to build it.
