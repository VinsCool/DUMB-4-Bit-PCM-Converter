# DUMB Soundchip Toolbox
A dumb Soundchip Toolbox I coded for a dumb project.

Anyone is free to tinker around, I don't really put much serious thoughts into it at the moment.
This project was made for fun, learning, and just experimenting ideas.
In its current form, there is pretty much nothing to be seen, but that's likely going to change in a near future.

How to use: [TODO: Write this] 

How to build:
- Linux: run **cmake** to generate the necessary files, then run **make** to build it.
